            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It is harder to know an holy walk than one act of grace: it is harder for any man to diſcern
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107788:6"/>that he leads an holy life, then that he performs a gracious act: for an holy life does conſiſt of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gracious actions; and it is harder to diſcern that a man has done many, then that he has done one: it is harder to find out many profitable herbs in the field than one; harder to diſcern many trains of Wheat among the Chaff, than one: it is harder to find many Evidences of a good E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate than one; to the diſcerning of many acts of trace, there is required more obſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, then to the diſcerning of one act of grace; if it be difficult to find one, it will be more difficult to find two, ten, an hundred: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that don't know that he has performed one act of grace, does not know that he leads an holy life. I may allude to that, Jer. 12.5. <hi>if thou haſt run with the foot men and they have wearied thee, how wilt thou contend with horſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If the holineſs of mens actions can't be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned ſeverally, it can't be diſcerned in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: if a man looks upon his actions ſeverally, and cannot ſay that this or that or any one was an holy action; he cannot ſay concerning any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it was an act of ſaving faith, or ſaving love; how can he when he looks upon his carria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges together, ſay they are holy, if there be no one action that he can ſay is ſincere; how can he ſay that his walk is ſincere: if a man ſees an heap of corn, how can he ſay, it is an heap of wheat, when he does not know, that there is one grain
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107788:6"/>of wheat there: the ſincerity of his walk depends upon the ſincerity of particular actions; and if that be hidden from him, how can he ſay his walk is ſincere: if for ought he knows every pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and duty be done in hypocriſy; then for ought he knows, his whole life is a life of hypocriſy: if he can inſtance in no action that is certainly otherwiſe, it may be ſo for ought that he knows; if he can't anſwer to this queſtion. <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.17. <hi>Loveſt thou me?</hi> or to that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.35. <hi>dost thou believe on the Son of God?</hi> or ſome ſuch like; he cannot tell that he lives an holy life: therefore ſuch a man can't prove his ſincerity from his walk. No walk can be evidential, but what is made up of acts of grace; therefore if he ſees none, he can have no evidence from his walk.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If there be no act of grace, there is no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; therefore if he ſees no act of grace, he ſees no ſincerity; when there is no act of grace, there is no principle of grace: though a man walk in print, yet there is no ſincerity; many carry themſelves very fairly, but if there be no grace, there is no uprightneſs in them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.42. <hi>I know you, that you have not the love of God in you;</hi> it is all counterfeit walk: they are like men upon the Stage, that perſonate other kind of men; ſo theſe men walk like Saints, and talk like Saints; but if there be no act of grace, they are no Saints, they want that which does conſtitute a Saint, therefore if a man do not know any act of grace
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107788:7"/>in himſelf, he can't know himſelf to be a Saint, though he walk like an Angel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The multiplication of ſuch acts as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Saints and hypocrites, don't ſhew him to are ſincere; prayer is common to Saints and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they tought him, they returned and enquired early after God;</hi> therefore if a man do this a thouſand times, it don't prove him to be a Saint; ſo morality is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Saints and hypocrites. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.20. and if a man carries morally, twenty years together, it don't ſhew him to be a Saint; ſo zeal, ſo delight in Sabbaths; if an hypocrite may do theſe things, then the multiplication of them, and walking in ſuch a way is no evidence; that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, let it be multiplied never ſo often, don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſaving: multiply cyphers, and they make no number: therefore there can be no evidence of a good eſtate from a mans walk, unleſs he knew ſome act of grace; if he can't diſcern ſome act of ſaving grace, he muſt be at a loſs about his ſincerity.</p>
